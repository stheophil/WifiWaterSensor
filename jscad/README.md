# How to render JSCAD files

Go to [http://openjscad.org]. 

1. To render the T-shaped interior that holds the battery, charger, and the Wifi chip, drag `common.jscad` and `inner/main.jscad` to the "Drop your jscad files ... here" area on the website.

2. To render the outer shell drag `common.jscad` and `outer/main.jscad` to the file area.

3. To render the hook that should be glued to the outer shell, drag `hook.jscad` to the file area.
